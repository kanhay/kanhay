### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Khadija Anhayfou, a student at 1337 (42 Network), where I am honing my skills in software development with a focus on system-level programming. My repositories showcase my work on various projects that are part of the 1337 Common Core curriculum. These include foundational programming concepts such as:

Libft: A personal implementation of the C standard library, focusing on key functions and memory management.
Get Next Line: A function to read a line from a file descriptor, mastering memory allocation and file handling.
Printf: A custom implementation of the printf function, working with variable arguments and string formatting.
Push Swap: A sorting algorithm project using stacks, testing both my problem-solving and algorithm design skills.
So Long: A 2D game developed with C, dealing with graphical rendering, event management, and efficient memory usage.
Pipex: A mini shell project that simulates piping functionality in Unix systems, involving process creation and inter-process communication.
Born2beroot: A project designed to set up a virtual machine (VM) and deploy a Linux distribution, strengthening my understanding of system administration.
Philosophers: A multithreading project inspired by the dining philosophers problem, tackling synchronization, concurrency, and deadlock prevention.
Minishell: A mini version of a Unix shell, enhancing my knowledge of process control, piping, and shell scripting.
NetPractice: A network-based project where I explored sockets, server-client communication, and protocols.
Webserv: A project to implement a basic web server, delving into HTTP requests, server responses, and network communication.

Through these projects, I aim to gain a deeper understanding of computer science principles, including algorithms, data structures, memory management, and low-level programming. Iâ€™m passionate about learning, problem-solving, and collaborating with others on exciting challenges.

Feel free to explore my work, and reach out if you're interested in discussing any projects!
