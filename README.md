Get Next Line: A function to read a line from a file descriptor, mastering memory allocation and file handling.
Printf: A custom implementation of the printf function, working with variable arguments and string formatting.
Push Swap: A sorting algorithm project using stacks, testing both my problem-solving and algorithm design skills.
So Long: A 2D game developed with C, dealing with graphical rendering, event management, and efficient memory usage.
Pipex: A mini shell project that simulates piping functionality in Unix systems, involving process creation and inter-process communication.
Born2beroot: A project designed to set up a virtual machine (VM) and deploy a Linux distribution, strengthening my understanding of system administration.
Philosophers: A multithreading project inspired by the dining philosophers problem, tackling synchronization, concurrency, and deadlock prevention.
Minishell: A mini version of a Unix shell, enhancing my knowledge of process control, piping, and shell scripting.
NetPractice: A network-based project where I explored sockets, server-client communication, and protocols.
IRC: A project to implement an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) server, exploring networking, message protocols, and client-server interactions.
Inception: A project focused on Docker and containerization, setting up multiple services using Docker Compose to enhance understanding of system orchestration and virtualization.
ft_transcendence: A full-stack web development project involving real-time multiplayer gaming, authentication, database management, and web sockets, integrating both frontend and backend technologies.

Feel free to explore my work, and reach out if you're interested in discussing any projects!
